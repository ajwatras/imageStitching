## Usage: 
In order to perform image stitching, run command: 

`python pistream_faststitch.py`



During streaming, the stitcher follows the following keyboard inputs:

`q` - quit the current script. 
`r` - re-calibrate the image stitcher
`0,1,2,3,4` - Change top image to camera of corresponding number
`,` - Rotate the panorama clockwise
`.` - Rotate the panorama counter clockwise



## Setup and Miscellaneous Notes:
Code is NOT compatible with Python 3.
Requires [Numpy(Should be compatible with most recent version)](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html)
Requires [OpenCV(Version 3.x)](https://opencv.org/releases.html)
Requires [OpenCV contrib-folder](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib)
It may be possible to use OpenCV Version 2.x without the OpenCV contrib_folder (this is NOT recommended as it is untested)
Currently the program does NOT seem compatible with Windows.


## File Overview:
#### (Main programs)
pistream_faststitch.py is used stitch a stream of multiple videos together into a panoramic video.
lazy_stitcher.py is used to stitch a multiple images together into a panoramic.
stitcher2.py is used to stitch two images together.
The files listed above are dependent on each other from top to bottom.

#### (Data)
Sample folder within the stitcher folder contains 4 videos: m.avi, the main or central view, and four side views that can be used to test the code.
The Data folder contains other miscellaneous videos and images to test different aspects of the program.
Including still frames to test only image stitching and calibration videos to test only calibration.
The Data folder should also include several output videos and images to show what the project is currently capable of

#### (Non-Main Programs)
stab_pistream_faststitch.py is meant to stabalize and stitch video at the same time; however, it is currently not in a working state and will not compile.
The tools folder contains test programs that were used in the creation of the project. It can still be used to test if a computer can open the and stream from a camera or file.
