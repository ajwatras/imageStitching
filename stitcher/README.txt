Demo Prestitched is the video from the demo in which all of the stitching is done during the calibration step. After calibration, no more stitching is done, we simply retain the transformation from the calibration step.

Demo Restitched was the main video from the demo. It contains the video with the re-stitching of moving objects. 

4vidstream contains the concatenated video from the four cameras. You can use it to get an idea of each of the views used in the stitching process.
