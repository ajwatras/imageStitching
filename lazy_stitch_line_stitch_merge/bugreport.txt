Patch 1.0.1
KNOWN BUGS (* indicates fixed)
*Bug 1: Side view frame 2 does not correctly remove foreground object.
*Bug 2: Side view frame may detect incorrect point correspondences when the coordinate system needs to be shifted. 
*Bug 3: There is no error correction for the failure case of line detection. (Line = 0,0)
*Bug 4: When lineEdge returns a failure case, it is treated as a successful case. (Should be corrected.)
*Bug 5: Epipolar matching may cause point correspondences from outside of the image to be used
*Bug 6: The algorithm is incorrectly applying lineEdge in frame 2. 
*Bug 7: When the algorithm can not find the lineEdge and there is a coordinate shift in H, the code does not behave properly. 
*Bug 8: Line-Edge intersection is not correctly being handled in image 1 due to the way the mask is being warped.

KNOWN ISSUES
Issue 1: Alignment takes too much time and must be sped up. (Determined that PairLines takes an inordinate amount of time.)
Issue 2: If object has not been detected in side view, alignment will not occur even if object is detected in other views. 
Issue 3: Alignment errors are too frequent. 
Issue 4: Alignment does not vary smoothly from frame to frame.
Issue 5: PairLines code takes too long and must be sped up. 
Issue 6: LineDetect seems to be selecting bad lines
Issue 7: Our method is not robust when edge lines are near parallel to epipolar lines.

FIXED ISSUE
Fix: Applied all background warps before all foreground warps so that corrected objects won't get stuck behind background.
Fix: Applied Dilation to seam mask so that the difference between image homography and point homography won't be a problem. 
Fix: Applied background filling before background warping so that object segmentation is handled correctly.
